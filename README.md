Each folder contains relevant data files (.csv, .png, .h5, etc.) and Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files.

## Requirements

The projects generally use the following Python libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow / keras
- pytorch (in some projects)
- opencv-python
- wordcloud, stylecloud
- and others (specified at the beginning of each notebook)

> **Note:** Each project's specific requirements are listed at the start or in the relevant cells of the notebook.

## How to Run?

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   or install according to the requirements listed at the top of each notebook.

2. Navigate to the relevant project folder and start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   cd <project_folder>
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the notebook file and run the cells step by step.
